# Stack and Queue Visualizer 🎨📊

A **C++** and **Raylib**-based tool to visualize stack and queue operations, including `push`, `pop`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and **reversing elements**. This project provides an interactive graphical interface to help users understand these fundamental data structures. 🔄

## 🔢 Features

### 🏋️‍♂️ Stack Visualizer
- **Push Operation**: ➕ Add elements to the stack.
- **Pop Operation**: ➖ Remove elements from the stack.
- **Reverse Stack**: ↻ Reverse the order of elements in the stack.
- **Display**: 🖊 Visual representation of stack elements.

### 🏃‍♂️ Queue Visualizer
- **Enqueue Operation**: ➕ Add elements to the queue.
- **Dequeue Operation**: ➖ Remove elements from the queue.
- **Reverse Queue**: ↻ Reverse the order of elements in the queue.
- **Display**: 🖊 Visual representation of queue elements.

## 🎨 How It Works
The application visualizes stack and queue operations using Raylib’s graphical capabilities. As users interact with the tool, they can see the **real-time changes** to the data structures, helping to build an intuitive understanding of their behavior.

### 🏃‍♂️ Stack Operations
1. **Push**: ➕ Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: ➖ Removes the top element of the stack.
3. **Reverse**: ↻ Flips the order of all elements in the stack.

### 🏃‍♂️ Queue Operations
1. **Enqueue**: ➕ Adds a new element to the rear of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: ➖ Removes the front element of the queue.
3. **Reverse**: ↻ Flips the order of all elements in the queue.
