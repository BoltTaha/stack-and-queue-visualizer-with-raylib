# Stack and Queue Visualizer

A C++ and Raylib-based tool to visualize stack and queue operations, including push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, and reversing elements. This project provides an interactive graphical interface to help users understand these fundamental data structures.

## Features

### Stack Visualizer
- **Push Operation:** Add elements to the stack.
- **Pop Operation:** Remove elements from the stack.
- **Peek Operation:** View the top element of the stack.
- **Reverse Stack:** Reverse the order of elements in the stack.
- **Display:** Visual representation of stack elements.

### Queue Visualizer
- **Enqueue Operation:** Add elements to the queue.
- **Dequeue Operation:** Remove elements from the queue.
- **Front Operation:** View the front element of the queue.
- **Rear Operation:** View the rear element of the queue.
- **Reverse Queue:** Reverse the order of elements in the queue.
- **Display:** Visual representation of queue elements.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Graphics Framework:** Raylib

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- **Raylib Library:** Download and set up Raylib from [raylib.com](https://www.raylib.com/).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BoltTaha/stack-queue-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stack-queue-visualizer
   ```
3. Ensure Raylib is installed and properly configured.

### Building and Running the Application
1. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o visualizer main.cpp -lraylib
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./visualizer
   ```

## Demonstration
(Add animated GIFs or screenshots of your tool in action to showcase the features.)

## How It Works
The application visualizes stack and queue operations using Raylib's graphical capabilities. As users interact with the tool, they can see the real-time changes to the data structures, helping to build an intuitive understanding of their behavior.

### Stack Operations
1. **Push:** Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop:** Removes the top element of the stack.
3. **Peek:** Displays the top element without removing it.
4. **Reverse:** Flips the order of all elements in the stack.

### Queue Operations
1. **Enqueue:** Adds a new element to the rear of the queue.
2. **Dequeue:** Removes the front element of the queue.
3. **Front/Rear:** Displays the front/rear element without removing it.
4. **Reverse:** Flips the order of all elements in the queue.
